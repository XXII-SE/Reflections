How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it assisted me note the difference to establish the cause of trouble

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would give me insights on efficiency of the program 
    I can trace source of bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    PRO'S
    I control when I commit
    Reduce redundancy that might occur by over commiting

    CONS
    Its human to forget and we might forget to commit 
    It won't be regular unless i am disciplined


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is robust while google is not
    google isn't made for coding
    The files used for google are relatively small

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I'll use git log to find out the commit history , focusing on name , date and description
    I'll use git diff (1st) (2nd) to find out the difference between the commits history
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control will allow me to see where the bug came from and revert back to previous versions insuring my work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    storing versions of my code 
    collaborating with other coders on a project
